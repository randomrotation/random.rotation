Description: This package provides and implementation of random rotation ensembles and extensions, as described in the research paper [Regularizing axis-aligned ensembles via
data rotations that favor simpler learners (2020)](http://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/rre/regsim.pdf) by R. Blaser and P. Fryzlewicz. It also provides a number of useful pre-processing utilities to normalise and impute data before applying rotations.
